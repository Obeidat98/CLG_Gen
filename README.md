## IMPORTANT ##
This Project was developed for training purposes only.
It is always recommended to write a sincere Cover Letter to the organization you are applying for.
It adds to your personal honesty and gives more authenticity to your application.

# Usage license is completely free regardless. Use it on your own responsibility.

# Usage:
To use this program, you must have 3 things ready.
1. Python
2. Dependency Libraries
3. Configured Cover Letter Template

# How it works
Normally when you write a cover letter, you open your word document and you start writing and filling the sender and receiver information as well as information about the job like the Job-Name, Job-ID, Job Skills, etc...
Going through those details can be confusing and time consuming due to the continous and careful filling of the document fearing that you might miss one of the necessary information. 
What this program does is that it gives you a UI Interface where you have all the necessary fields to adjust, which you can input the information of the job application field after another.

You can also conveniently choose to:
1. Generate a PDF File Ready to be uploaded directly to the job application
2. Or choose a DOCX document where it generates a word file that you can still edit manually in case you needed further necessary adjustments for your cover letter.

# Add-Ons (Beta):
# Feature_1: Google Search (Google-View)
Usually when you are looking for the company information, you will fill the Company Name and the City Name and then get stuck trying to find the street name and the PLZ number for the specific branch of the company.
This feature allows you to manually input the name of the company and its city and then click "Search Google-View" to directly be taken to google with a prompt for the company name and the city it's located in.
What this usually does is that it takes you to a page that google normally recommends the long location for the searched company including the street and the PLZ and all the other necessary links and information.
From there you can simply copy the address correctly and paste it to your Generator Program.
Upcoming: Automatic pulling of the full address with One-Click.

# Feature_2: Google Search (In-Program View)
The same goes for this feature as the Google-View Search feature, except that this feature gives you a list of the first 5 matching links with the company you are looking for inside the program directly.
Clicking on any of the links takes you to its website directly.
Recommended: You will find that you will be using Google-View feature more often due to its speed and flexibility 

# Feature_3: LinkedIn Automatic Pull
This feature is still experimental but it works 70% of the time. It allows you to grab the link of the LinkedIn job offer that you want to apply for, and it pulls the data from it and automatically fills most of the fields for your application.
NOTE: Always double check the information that you received. Sometimes the job offer can be written in a way that messes up or switches some values. DOUBLE CHECK.
Upcoming: Automatic pulling of the Data of any Job Offer powered by AI.

# Configuration of The Cover Letter
In order for the program to actually give you a tailored cover letter based on your template, you need to configure your template correctly.
Main Key Format that you need to consider goes between two curly brackets such as: {{KEY_1}}, {{KEY_2}}, {{YOUR_KEY_3}}.
The main current (Up-To-Date) Keys are:
1. {{COMPANY_NAME}}
2. {{GREETING}}
3. {{PRONOUN}}
4. {{PERSONAL_NAME}}
5. {{LAST_NAME}}
6. {{STREET_NAME}}
7. {{COMPANY_PLZ}}
8. {{COMPANY_CITY}}
9. {{JOB_TITLE_LONG}}
10. {{JOB_TITLE_SHORT}}
11. {{JOB_ID}}
12. {{TODAY_DATE}}
13. {{SKILL1}}
14. {{SKILL2}}

You basically need to embed each one of those Keys inside your Cover Letter Template in order for the program to correctly identify it and replace its content with the Fields you fill out each time in the Interface.

Upcoming: More Keys and features will be added in a more flexible way soon, allowing you to have any naming convention you want in your templates.

Upcoming: This program might develop soon to be a template filler and include may more features and capabilites. Sadly, it was just a project for fun in the meantime.
